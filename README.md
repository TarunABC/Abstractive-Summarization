Text summarization is the process of condensing a larger body of text into a shorter, concise version while retaining the main ideas and essential information. It is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) that helps users efficiently consume large amounts of information.

There are two primary approaches to text summarization:

1. Extractive Summarization
This method selects key sentences or phrases directly from the source text to form the summary.
It relies on algorithms to identify the most important parts of the text based on factors such as sentence ranking, word frequency, or semantic importance.
While extractive summarization produces summaries that are verbatim excerpts from the original text, they may not always flow naturally.

3. Abstractive Summarization
This approach generates summaries in natural language that may include rephrased or synthesized information not explicitly present in the original text.
Abstractive methods require a deeper understanding of the text and involve techniques like sequence-to-sequence models, attention mechanisms, and transformers (e.g., GPT or BERT).
These summaries tend to be more concise and fluent but are also more computationally intensive.
